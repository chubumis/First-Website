        <h3>Buck Imane</h3>
        <p id="reference">Hi everyone my name is Buck, the creator of Rubix Rejuvinator. I decided to create this site to help
            people who were once just like me to solve the Rubix Cube. It took me months to figure out how to solve this wonderous cube
            and I'd like to share what I learned so that anyone can learn to solve it as fast as they want!
